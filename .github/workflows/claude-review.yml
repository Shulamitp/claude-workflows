            SECURITY REVIEW — PR DIFF BELOW

            {{ file:pr.diff }}

            For every security issue:
            - Write a GitHub PR review comment
            - Explain the risk
            - Suggest a fix

            If no issues exist:
            - Write confirmation comment

            Missing authorization = critical vulnerability.
